### Executive summary
In an increasingly digitized world, cooperatives face challenges in adopting new technologies to stay relevant and competitive. Despite facing many difficulties, many cooperatives still prefer the traditional way of providing services. There is a disconnect between production, processing, and marketing, resulting in significant losses for farmers and cooperatives. These have contributed to the questioned leadership, management systems, and transparency in financial systems within cooperatives. And also, members lack access to market information, necessary inputs, and credits, hindering production and profitability. Digitalization is a necessity to facilitate communication, improve efficiency, and increase the reach within the cooperatives. Moreover, digitization has significantly improved the effectiveness of how cooperatives operate. By combining digital tools and the principles of cooperation, cooperatives can maintain long-term success by successfully adapting to technological change.
